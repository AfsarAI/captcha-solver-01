# CAPTCHA Solver Demo ApplicationThis project demonstrates a simple client-side CAPTCHA solver application. It features a user interface to display a static CAPTCHA image and allows users to input the text for verification. The application is built using a single HTML file, styled with Tailwind CSS, and includes basic JavaScript logic for CAPTCHA verification.**Note:** This is a simplified demo and does not represent a robust, secure CAPTCHA system suitable for production environments, as the correct answer is hardcoded on the client-side.## Features- Displays a predefined CAPTCHA image (`image.png`).- Input field for users to enter the CAPTCHA text.- Verify button to check the user's input.- Dynamic feedback message for success or failure.- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.## How to Run1.  **Clone the repository (or save the files):** If you received these files, ensure `index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `image.png` are in the same directory.2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.There is no build process or server required, as it's a static client-side application.## Technologies Used-   **HTML5:** For the page structure.-   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and ensuring responsiveness.-   **JavaScript:** For handling user input and CAPTCHA verification logic.## Project Structure```- project-root|- index.html|- image.png|- README.md|- LICENSE```## LicenseThis project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
